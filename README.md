# qcap-demos

This is a C++ project that demonstrates and tests the features of the `qcap` video and audio capture library.

This project includes a main sample application (`qdemo`), a utility library (`zzlab`), and a complex `make`-based build system that provides a high degree of cross-platform compatibility.

## Getting Started

This project uses `make` for compilation. You need to build for a target platform defined in the `mkfiles` directory.

### 1. Compilation

Choose a target platform and run the `make` command. For example, to compile for the `l4t-r36-2` (NVIDIA Jetson L4T R36.2) platform:

```bash
# Replace l4t-r36-2 with your target platform and QCAP_HOME with the path to the qcap library
QCAP_HOME=/your-qcap-root/l4t-r36-2 make -f l4t-r36-2.mk -j4
```

After a successful compilation, all generated files (including executables) will be placed in the `_objs/<your-target-platform>/` directory.

### 2. Execution

The executables are located in the corresponding platform's `_objs` subdirectory.

```bash
# Run the qdemo sample application
./_objs/l4t-r36-2/qdemo
```
